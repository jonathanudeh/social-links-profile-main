### What I learnt
This time around i didnt just use css grid. I combined flexbox which I'll is my strength and grid which I am starting to love for this project. So that gave me indepth knowledge about them both.

### Continued development
I will be using more of css grid layout as well as flexbox so as to get really familiarized with them both even though my flexbox skills are a lot smoother than that of my grid.
